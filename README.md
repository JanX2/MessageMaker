# MessageMaker
A friend of mine was writing fanfic and wanted a way to generate a lot of text message screenshots out of raw text. I wanted a way to practice the SwiftUI I was learning so here we are!

## Formatting Rules
- Each line of text counts as one message
- First message is from "you"
- Leaving a blank line changes the sender
- Adding a line with "--" on both sides will create bold timestamp text
- Text to the right of "|" in a timestamp will not be bold
- Timestamp text as a first line or after a blank line will appear in the middle as a date stamp.
- Timestamp text directly after a message will appear under that message as a read stamp.
