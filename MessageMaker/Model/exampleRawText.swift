I've finally finished 100 Days of SwiftUI!!!

Awesome!

3 months, coding in Swift every day, and then WWDC 2020 in the last week

So are you going to make some apps now?

A friend some way to make text message bubbles from raw text so I said I could build it in SwiftUI.

Cool, can I see it?

You're in it!
